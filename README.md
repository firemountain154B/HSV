## Highlighted verification strategy and Difficulties
In this courework, the main goal is to use verification tool to verify AHBGPIO and VGA using a variety of tools, including checking the simulation wave, code/functional coverage, SVA for formal verification. 

### The main verification flow
In most of the work, I started from understanding the timing specification of a peripheral first, then giving random input, always there will be several bugs, and checking the waveform and related code, get the correctly final output. So I flow the instruction of link here(The Structure o f testbech reference) [https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_42493102/article/details/121217275],

### Difficulties 
#### Understanding the structure
The overall structure, I would like to cite the website here, which offers me the knowledge how to build a structure of the testbench, and what's the role of different part in testbench, like interface, random class, checker, or monitor. Figure out theset

The important thing to do the verification strategy is like 

• Any important points about your verification strategy and any difficulties that
you encountered
• Brief summary of your verification results
